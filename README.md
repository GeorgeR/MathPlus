# MathPlus
Additional math and geometric types for Unreal Engine 4.

All types should implement the following:
1. Operators
2. FString ToString()
3. Conversion
4. Validation of templated combinations
5. Be non-ambiguous semantically, thus the distinction between a Point and Vector
6. Support non-const and const
7. Scalar and vector overloads
8. Equality and GetTypeHash()
